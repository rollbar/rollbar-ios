The Apple SDK is a modernized approach to collecting errors from Apple devices and fixes many iOS SDK pain points. Please, consider migrating over to the Apple SDK. You can find its documentation [here](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/apple). Please open an [issue](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-apple/issues) or contact our support if you encounter problems.

# Roadmap Note

We are recommending all current users of the Rollbar-iOS SDK to start making plans for upgrading from this SDK by moving to its new reincarnation that is our new [Rollbar-Apple SDK](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-apple). 
All new feature development will be happening only within the new SDK and this SDK will be retiring soon.
All the new users that are looking into using Rollbar on any of the Apple platforms should start by using the new Rollbar-Apple SDK.
