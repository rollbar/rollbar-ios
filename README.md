# Rollbar for iOS

<!-- RemoveNext -->
Objective-C library for crash reporting and logging with [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com).

## Install

### With [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/)

In your Podfile:

    pod "Rollbar", "~> 0.2.0"

Make sure to declare your platform as `ios` at the top of your Podfile. E.g:

    platform :ios, '7.0'

Be sure to remember to `pod install` after changing your Podfile!

### Without Cocoapods

1. Download the [Rollbar framework](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/releases/download/v0.2.0/Rollbar.zip).

2. Extract the Rollbar directory in the zip file to your Xcode project directory.

3. In Xcode, select _File_ -> _Add Files to "[your project name]"_ and choose the Rollbar directory from step 2.

Note: if step three doesn't work you can also extract the Rollbar directory anywhere, and drag the `.framework` files into XCode, allowing XCode to correctly configure the Frameworks.

## Setup

In your Application delegate implementation file, add the following import statement:

```objc
#import <Rollbar/Rollbar.h>
```

Then add the following to `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`:

```objc
[Rollbar initWithAccessToken:@"POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN"];
```

<!-- RemoveNext -->
Replace `POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a client scope access token from your project in Rollbar

That's all you need to do to report crashes to Rollbar. To get symbolicated stack traces, follow the instructions in the "Symbolication" section below.

### Crash reporting

Crashes will be saved to disk when they occur, then reported to Rollbar the next time the app is launched.

Rollbar uses [PLCrashReporter](https://www.plcrashreporter.org/) to capture uncaught exceptions and fatal signals. Note that only one crash reporter can be active per app. If you initialize multiple crash reporters (i.e. Rollbar alongside other services), only the last one initialized will be active.

### Swift

Importing with Swift requires the additional step of adding the following lines to your Bridging-Header file:

```c
#import <SystemConfiguration/SystemConfiguration.h>
#import <Rollbar/Rollbar.h>
```

If you have no Bridging Header file, the easiest way to correctly configure it is to add an empty objective-c (`dummy.m` for instance) file. When you do so, XCode will prompt you to create a bridging header file, and will configure your build environment to automatically include those headers in all your Swift files. After creating the Bridging-Header file, you can delete the objective-c file.

Import `Rollbar` in your `AppDelegate` class file:

```swift
import Rollbar
```

The initialization uses Swift syntax:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    let config: RollbarConfiguration = RollbarConfiguration()
    config.environment = "production"

    Rollbar.initWithAccessToken("POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN", configuration: config)

    return true
}
```

See the [these commits](https://github.com/Crisfole/SwiftWeather/compare/18580ce...e7d80e1) for a demo of how to integrate Rollbar into an existing Swift project.

### Bitcode

Bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled iOS/watchOS program.  Apps you upload to iTunes Connect that contain bitcode will be compiled and linked on the App Store. Including Bitcode will allow Apple to re-optimize your app binary in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the store.

Apple will generate new dSYMs for Bitcode enabled builds that have been released to the iTunes store or submitted to TestFlight. You'll need to download the new dSYMs from Xcode and then upload them to Rollbar so that crashes can be symbolicated.

dSYMs for Bitcode enabled apps can be downloaded from Xcode's Organizer. Select the desired Archive of your app and click the "Download dSYMs..." button. If you're unable to download your dSYM from Xcode's Organizer, you'll have to get it from iTunes Connect.

In iTunes Connect, select "My Apps" on the page header and "Activity" on the top navigation tab bar. Select the build you want to download the dSYMs for and click on "Download dSYM" under "Includes Symbols".

Finally, upload the dSYM to Rollbar via your project's dSYM settings page.

### Logging

You can log arbitrary messages using the log methods:

```objc
// Logs at level "info".
// Variants at "debug", "info", "warning", "error", and "critical" all exist.
[Rollbar infoWithMessage:@"Test message"];

// Log a critical, with some additional key-value data
[Rollbar criticalWithMessage:@"Unexpected data from server" data:@{@"endpoint": endpoint,
                                                                    @"result": result}];

// Or log at a named level
[Rollbar logWithLevel:@"warning" message:@"Simple warning log message"];
```

## Configuration

You can pass an optional `RollbarConfiguration` object to `initWithAccessToken:`:

```objc
RollbarConfiguration *config = [RollbarConfiguration configuration];
config.crashLevel = @"critical";
config.environment = @"production";

[Rollbar initWithAccessToken:@"POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN" configuration:config];
```

You can also configure the notifier after initialization by getting the active configuration object and modifying it:

```objc
RollbarConfiguration *config = [Rollbar currentConfiguration];
[config setPersonId:@"123" username:@"username" email:@"test@test.com"];

// Will now report with person data
[Rollbar debugWithMessage:@"User hit button A"];
```

### Configuration reference ###

  <dt>crashLevel</dt>
  <dd>The level that crashes are reported as

Default: ```error```
  </dd>

  <dt>environment</dt>

Default: ```unspecified``` in release mode, ```development``` in debug mode.
  </dd>
  <dt>endpoint</dt>
  <dd>URL items are posted to.

  </dd>
  </dl>

**Methods:**
  <dl>
  <dt>`- setPersonId:username:email:`</dt>
  <dd>Sets person data. Each value can either be a `NSString` or `nil`
  </dd>
  </dl>

## Symbolication using .dSYM files

To automatically send .dSYM files to Rollbar whenever your app is built in release mode, add a new build phase to your target in Xcode:

1. Click on your project and then select "Build Phases"

2. In the top menu bar, click "Editor" and then "Add Build Phase", then "Add Run Script Build Phase"

3. Change the "Shell" to `/usr/bin/python`

4. Paste the contents of the [upload_dsym.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollbar/rollbar-ios/master/upload_dsym.py) script into the box, using "Paste and Preserve Formatting" (Edit -> Paste and Preserve Formatting)

  Note: make sure you replace `POST_SERVER_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a server scope access token from your project in Rollbar.

## Developing and building the library ##

You can include the Rollbar project as a sub-project in your app, or link the Rollbar source files directly into your app.
To develop the library by linking the source files directly in your app:

1. Fork this repo
2. git clone your fork
3. In Xcode, remove the Rollbar files from your project if they are currently there
4. In Xcode, add the Rollbar/ files:
    1. Right-click your project
    2. Click "Add Files to <project name>"
    3. Navigate to your rollbar-ios clone and select the Rollbar folder
    4. Click "Add"
5. In Xcode, add the PLCrashReporter framework:
    1. Click your project
    2. Click the General settings tab
    3. Under "Linked Frameworks and Libraries", click the +
    4. Click "Add Other..."
    5. Navigate to your rollbar-ios clone, then Vendor/
    6. Select CrashReporter.framework and click "Open"

You should now be able to build your app with your local clone of rollbar-ios.

To build the Rollbar framework distribution files, open the Rollbar project and make sure the Distribution scheme is active by selecting _Editor_ -> _Scheme_ -> _Distribution_. Building the project with this scheme selected will create a `Dist/` directory containing the Rollbar framework with the proper fat binary.
